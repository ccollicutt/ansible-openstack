## Requirements

Working installation of 

* ansible
* vagrant
  * will require a working version of ruby and bundler

## Quickstart

Upon first checkout

  $ bundle
  $ vagrant up

The bundle command will install the needed components to run the vagrant
vms with the ansible plugin.

## Plan?

1. Install and configure openstack into one VM
1. Break out compute node to install into its own VM or VM's

Should target folsom or newer releases in a long term supported linux
distro (either Ubuntu 12.04 or RHEL6 derived system).
